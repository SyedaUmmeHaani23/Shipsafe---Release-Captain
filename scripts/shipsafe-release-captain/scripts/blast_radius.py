"""
blast_radius.py — look up how many people depend on a package, as a proxy
for "blast radius" before publishing a new version.

Usage:
    python blast_radius.py <package_name> <npm|pypi>

Prints a one-line, human-readable summary the agent can drop straight into
its approval prompt. Exits with a clear message (not a crash) if the
registry can't be reached, so the agent can honestly say "couldn't check"
instead of guessing.
